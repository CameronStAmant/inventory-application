# inventory-application

This application uses Node and Express to create an inventory system for a store. Categories and items for those categories can be created, read, updated, and deleted. Data validation and sanitization is done on newly entered data. Pug and SCSS were used to familiarize myself with preprocessors. MongoDB and mongoose were used for the backend. A demo of the site can be accessed [here](https://immense-castle-68660.herokuapp.com/).
